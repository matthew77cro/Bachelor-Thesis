# Bachelor-Thesis - Evolution of Artificial Neural Network Architecture
Bachelor Thesis (Computer Science) at FER@UniZG - Evolution of Artificial Neural Network Architecture

Artificial neural networks are nowadays a widely used machine learning model that has many applications in approximation and classification tasks. They can be used as agents' management subsystems, where based on environmental perception, they decide on the next actions of the agent they control. As a part of this bachelor thesis, it is necessary to study suitable approaches for the evolution of artificial neural network architecture. For the chosen agent control problem, it is necessary to develop a prototype software solution that will allow the evolution of a suitable neural network, as well as the simulation and visualization of the world in which the agent operates. Examine and comment on the effectiveness of the implemented approach given the varying severity of the problems that the agent is facing. Algorithms, source codes, and results should be provided with the necessary explanations and documentation. Cite the literature used and indicate the assistance received.
